TO DO LIST:

- create other pages + materials/components within them
- ensure routing as "multiple pages in one page" is working as intended
- dig into CSS and visual design from there
- look into extra ideas to implement to make site more impressive
- Add more "professional" type photos to spread throughout site

Ideas to Consider Implementing:

- Consistently playing mp3 file that retains between pages (hence method of routing)
- Adding animations to aspects of pages (hover animation for headshot and other pictures, smooth scrolling for different parts of pages, etc.)
-
