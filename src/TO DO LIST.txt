TO DO LIST:

Site Features:
- create other pages + materials/components within them
- ensure routing as "multiple pages in one page" is working as intended (do testing using audio player)
- look into extra features to implement to make site more impressive
- convert m4a file to mp3 and test if looping implementation works
- create non-auto focused dialog that audio player is controllable in, try to figure out how to make it a consistent entity in the bottom right corner of user's screen, a la Twitter DMs tab
    - consider using FAB button due to elevated visual nature and likely easier placement implementation
    - consider usage of FundamentalNGX library since it has wider dialog implementation and customizability
- Look into other libraries to possibly implement features (also find out if using and mixing multiple libraries can cause issues)
    - FundamentalNGX
    - PrimeNG
    - NG-Bootstrap

Visual Flair + Personal Advertising:

- remove default navbar page css (don't need to do anything wild, just make it *not* the default)
- dig into CSS and visual design from there (good color scheme, unique but readable font)
- Add more "professional" type photos to spread throughout site (not necessarily same type as the headshot, but stuff like the cornfield pictures)
- add "hover" animations to images such as headshot, to give more responsiveness and visual flair



Ideas to Consider Implementing:

- Adding animations to aspects of pages (hover animation for headshot and other pictures, smooth scrolling for different parts of pages, etc.)
- Make Projects page have some type of embed to give extra flair to showing off projects
    - try making a tab system that lets me have multiple images to click through and an embedded link underneath
