TO DO LIST:

- create other pages + materials/components within them
- ensure routing as "multiple pages in one page" is working as intended
- dig into CSS and visual design from there
- look into extra ideas to implement to make site more impressive
- Add more "professional" type photos to spread throughout site
- convert m4a file to mp3 and test if looping implementation works
- create non-auto focused dialog that audio player is controllable in, place it either in the footer or slightly above it

Ideas to Consider Implementing:

- Adding animations to aspects of pages (hover animation for headshot and other pictures, smooth scrolling for different parts of pages, etc.)
-
